# My Books

## About The Project

This is a Web Application, one of the last Capstone projects from Angela Yu's Full-Stack Web Developer course on Udemy. The name of this Web Application is My Books. It's where user can put books they have read, their notes, their ratings and when they read them. The books are sortable by rating, recency and title. Objectives were to integrate public APIs using Express/Node.js for server-side programming and to use PostgreSQL Database to persist data.

## Features

Features of the applications are:

- it uses the Open Library Covers API to fetch book covers
- it uses a database to store books you have read
- there is a way to add new data about books, update previous reviews and delete entries
- it displays this information from the database
- it sorts book entries by rating and recency

Predefined Project Setup:

- Set up a new Node.js project using Express.js
- Include pg for working with your localhost PostgreSQL database
